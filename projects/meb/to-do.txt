1. Display silkscreen for ALL components reference designators AS IS from the schematic
  - (i.e. "SW1" should acutally be SW31, "Relay Input" should be P15, "MSP430 FR5969 Launchpad" would be U21)
2. Add a silkscreen text description (not a component parameter) for the following components:
  - SW31: ON
  - SW32: OFF
  - P31: SYS
  - P11: BAMF
  - P12: I2C
  - P13: KILL
  - P15: SSR
  - P16: BRD_POWER
  - U21: MSP430 FR5969 Launchpad
3. Add a gap between the ground plane and edge of the PCB 
  - reference the opto-board if you aren't sure about the size of the gap
  - this will require expanding the left (and possibly top) border by a small amount to accomidate for the traces close to the edge
  - it's fine if the ground plane is not completed around the mounting holes since they aren't grounded
